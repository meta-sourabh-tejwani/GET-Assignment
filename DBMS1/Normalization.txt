Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.
It divides the larger table into the smaller table and links them using relationship
Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations.
It is also used to eliminate the undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies.
Type of Normal form:
1NF
2NF
3NF
BCNF

First Normal Form(1NF):
A relation will be 1NF if it contains an atomic value.
It states that an attribute of a table cannot hold multiple values. 
It must hold only single-valued attribute.

Example
id      name     Number 
1     Sourabh   9511556358,7023736737
Here mobile no have multiple value which is it violate the rule of first NF.
*********************************
After changing in 1NF
id      name     Number 
1     Sourabh    9511556358
1     Sourabh    7023736737

*********************************
Second Normal Form(2NF):
First it will be in 1Nf.
In the second normal form, all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key

id    name    age
1    sourabh   21
Here name and age are not fully dependent on primary key which is it violate the rule of second NF.
*********************************
After changing in 2NF
id   name
1    sourabh
*********************************
id   age
1     21
*********************************  
Third Normal Form(3NF):
A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and not contain any transitive partial dependency.
3NF is used to reduce the data duplication.
If there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes then the relation must be in third normal form.

id    name     zip    city      state
1   sourabh  313002  udaipur  rajasthan

here city and state depend on zip and zip depend on id which is it violate the rule of third NF.
*********************************  
After convert into 3NF
id    name       zip
1    sourabh    313002

zip     state      city
313002  rajasthan  udaipur

Boyce Codd normal form:
Also known as BCNF
The table in 3NF.
It is advance version of 3NF.
A table is in BCNF if every functional dependency X â†’ Y, X is the super key of the table.
id   country    depatment   department no
1     india      software      12
*********************************  
After changing in BCNF
id     country
1       india

department    departmentno
software 	12
